Checkers
========

A simple console checkers game largely built in ruby. Built in one day!

## Installation

After copying the repo, run bundle install to ensure you have the gem **colorize**
so output works.

## Running the game
Run from console:

```bash
> ruby game.rb
```

## Moving a piece
Select a piece to move by hitting  **<ENTER>**. Then select the next spot
the piece will go to by hitting  **<ENTER>** again. For multiple jumps continue
doing. When you have selected all your moves press **d** to run your move.

You can quit the game by pressing **q** at anytime.
